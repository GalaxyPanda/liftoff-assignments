# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project idea is a creating a website that generate project ideas. I came up with idea while trying to figure out a project do while waiting for lift off again. I think it this project could help with those who want to build on their experience or those that need some ideas. This could also be used for educational purposes such as helping teachers create lessons plans.
### Features
Some features on the site would include the ability to create an user profile, adding user suggestions, add friends and groups, and git integration. 
Project Generation: The generation system is the main feature of the site. Users should be able to generate a form that gives them information based on the category they chose as well tiny details they want the site to generate such as a client information (based on category), Color scheme or base color, and type of style the site should be (like font).
Suggestion form: There should be a form that allow users to add more words to the database. If the form detects any obscure suggestions such as slurs or profanity, it should throw an error at the user. Otherwise, the form will be submitted. 

User profiles: It should be optional for an user to create a profile to display work that they created based off the generated client idea suggested on the site. I think there should be three different logins. There should be one for hobbyists and casual use. The other two would be on educational purposes like a teacher and students accounts.

Communities/Classroom: a community feature can help make the site educational to allow classes for class projects and lessons. Hobbyists could use it to create projects together or have community events. If it is monitored properly, both ideal groups can encourage suggestion, reviews of the usersâ€™ projects and network.
Git integration: If the end user displays their work on the site, they should be able to connect their account with their GitHub. Especially if they want to use the GitHub website feature that GitHub offers.  

I believe these features would be essential for the website. I think in the beginning we simplify some f the features.

### Technologies
I think we should use Java with Spring, hibernate, and Mysql for the backend. For the frontend, we should use Thymeleaf templates with HTML, css, and some javascript.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I want to learn more on how use Javascript more frontend as well as how it can work with Java. I would like to learn how to use some APIs for github as well as Google services.
